I need to take into consideration that the documents will be in images 
that are taken from photos , so that means I'll have an inconsitent layout
so one way to tackle this problem is by cropping out the images.


1.ALGORITHM - Medium
A.Read input image
B.Crop document from image photograph 
C.Perform OCR on the cropped image
D.Output predicted text

-Based on the algorithm that we have applied we can see that the results are based
on the quality of the image.  think what I can do is focus on extracting the face 
and maatching it 

-I have manage to implement the algorithm from the medium post, what ill try to is create a function
that will incoperate the code, so that i can see test the code on different images 

- Manage to create a function, 


2.AGORITHM - Google colab 
This one is mostly suited for the work that we are doing , what we will try to do 
is detect the card in the image and extract the information from the string.

How good it performs, to be honest, its not that good. The thresholding is not producing 
that we would like. I'll try to implement Adaptive thresholding.

text2 is the value that contains our data , which is in string profmat.
what are the most important information from This
-name 
-surname
-ID number 

- need more work on extraction of data, the thresholding is failing me , gives me poor results 
at the moment I am using grayscale.The problem with it is that its not robust to images
that have exposure to lighting.


3.Identify Face
What I'll do next is identify the image in the card.
-managed to crop the faces from the text.

-Been trying to load the dlib into the system
-giving me errors with model compatibility.
-the problem that i am facing is identifying the face from the card, I will need to implement
the function that i created , false error there was a problem in my code.
-create a function that will take a picture from the main camera.
-managed to put text on the webcam
-need to create a display to show the results.
-need to create the function step by step, since it has some erros
