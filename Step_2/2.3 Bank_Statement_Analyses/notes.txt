1.managed to add add an Pdf to image convertos
2.managed to extract data from the file , now its time to obtain basic information
based on this analysis we created a list that extracts the first values of the banks statemnt
what is returened was a list that has a length of 317 values. What I want to do is return the name 
of the user.
3.Need to find a way to structure the data, Since it has a particuler format what I need to do 
is find a way I can place that Data.
-Managed to create a pandas dataframe,not sure if the values are correct. Its something 
I need to look into.
-Discovered that there are more keyword in the file that I can use As landmark 
. "Money In", "Money Out", "Balance"
-Need to crop segments of information. Beacuse there are some parts that I dont think I will use 
I have noticed that some descriptions are and they end upopening spaces of new lines
-Since we have inconsitentcy within our pdf what I will try to do is implement a library 
to see how it handles the situation.
- I have been trying to find a way to extract the bank statemnt data But I can't fid modules that help me 
do that. So I will try to extract it through functions and openCV
- Manged to extract data from the first Page.
-I have noticed that the first and the other pages have a different format. What I will try to do 
is create a function that can accomodate all the page.
-The approach that I was trying to implement is kinda flawed, What I am going to do is try and extract the data 
vertically.
-I had a problem with the stamp situatioan , but I realized that I do not need to extract Money in or Money out what 
I have to do is find  the balance between the two.
