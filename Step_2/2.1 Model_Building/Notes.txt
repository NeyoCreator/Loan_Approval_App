were going to create a notebook where we look at the different models 
that we can implement, afater that we will try to create a web application
where a user inputs their data and the model predicts if they qualify for the loan or 
not.At the momemnt we are working with the dataset from kaggle.our job would be to 
extract data from from a bank statement and and payslip.

we will start with a basic dataset and then we will graduallly work our way up.

-Based on the results the Logistic regression gave me the best perfomance with an f1-score 
of 1 and an accuracy of 1. Still need to consider the size of the dataset needs to be incrased
and the content of the data needs to be changed.

-created a pickle model that we will deploy on the application with a new tutorial , this one is more 
relevant to the project that i am doing , plus the person is implemntig neural networks. my jo would e 
to automate the suystem. improve on the autheticatio, the ui 

1.Notebook 

the preprocessing steps that we took 
1.1 dealt with missing values by dealeting columns that didn't have any values.when 
we deal with a larger dataset what I'll do is imute the missing value with a mean or a median

1.2 Encode categorical values 
1.3 Used smote analysis to balance the data 
1.4 Scaled the numerical values 

The results that I got model that gave me 93% accuracy and 0.17 loss 
TN = 51
FN = 14
FP = 11
TP = 57

2.Pickle the model
now that we have bult our model , what we'll do is pickle it. This will allow us to make predictions 
on different data and use it as a utility.
